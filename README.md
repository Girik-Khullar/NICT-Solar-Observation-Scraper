# NICT Solar Spectra Scraper

## Introduction

This repository contains a web scraper designed to extract solar radio dynamic spectra data from the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) database. The scraper collects data from:

- **HiRAS**: Solar radio dynamic spectra from 1996 to 2016.
- **YAMAGAWA**: Solar radio dynamic spectra from 2016 to present.

The data can be used for research and analysis of solar phenomena.
